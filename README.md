# challenge.me

This is a personal project I am completing to learn android development. The idea of this app is to provide users with small, daily challenges that will shake up their normal day-to-day life. Completing challenges will result in a gain of experience. Experience is used to level up through tiers, to gamify it a bit. Along with the small challenges, there is a big weekly challenge that users can complete, worth more experience.

Through this project I will learn basic UI design in android, basic android development, user registration in android, database handling & PHP.

Ideas for further down the line:
  1. Have users be able to connect with each other, e.g. facebook friends, to compare scores and levels
  2. Share what challenges users have completed on social media
  3. Micro-transactions
