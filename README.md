# challenge.me

This is a personal project I am completing to learn android development. The idea of this app is to provide users with small, daily challenges that will shake up their normal day-to-day life. Completing challenges will result in a gain of experience. Experience is used to level up through tiers, to gamify it a bit. Along with the small challenges, there is a big weekly challenge that users can complete, worth more experience.

Through this project I will learn basic UI design in android, basic android development, user registration in android, & database handling.

Now that I'm done with this project, I will share what I've learned:
  1. Basic UI design in Android: I learned how to work with the xml code that Android development requires.
  2. Basic logic flow in Android: Activities and Intents, manipulating the UI
  3. Firebase: This is the host I chose for the database. Working through the docs was work, but I eventually got the hang of it. I am using the database and the cloud functions for my app.
  4. HTTP-Requests: I wrote a bit of JS that pings the database and edits some data.
  5. Cron-job: I deployed the piece of JS using "cron-job.org" so that it will execute every day at midnight.

Ideas for further down the line:
  1. Have users be able to connect with each other, e.g. facebook friends, to compare scores and levels
  2. Share what challenges users have completed on social media
  3. Micro-transactions
